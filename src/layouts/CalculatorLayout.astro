  CalculatorLayout.astro

  This layout wraps calculator pages with the global BaseLayout and
  applies consistent spacing and typography.  It accepts the
  `title` and `description` props and passes them through to
  BaseLayout.  The <slot /> allows the MDX content to be rendered
  within an article element.  Using a dedicated layout for
  calculators makes it easy to customise the styling of just these
  pages in the future (e.g. adding a table of contents, ads or
  related calculators), without affecting other parts of the site.
