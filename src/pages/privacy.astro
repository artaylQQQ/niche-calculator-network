  <h1><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>


<br>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    We at CalcSimpler.com ("we", "our", or "us") respect your privacy and are committed
    to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we (and our
    third-party partners) may collect when you use our site, and how we use and
    safeguard that information. By using our website, you agree to the terms of this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Our online calculators run entirely in your web browser. We do not collect or store
    any personal data you enter into the calculators. In fact, we do not require you to
    create accounts or provide personal information to use our tools. All calculation
    inputs and results remain on your device and are not sent to our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    We use privacy-friendly analytics tools to understand how users interact with our
    website. Importantly, our analytics do not use cookies or collect personally
    identifiable information. The data we see is aggregated (for example, total page
    visits or usage statistics) and helps us improve the site’s content and usability
    without tracking individual users.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Our site displays advertisements through third-party advertising networks. These ads
    help us keep the service free. Be aware that ad networks may use cookies and similar
    technologies to show you relevant ads based on your browsing history or interests.
    This means third-party vendors may place and read cookies on your browser, or use web
    beacons to collect information, in the course of ads being served on our site.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not have access to or control over the cookies and data collected by third-party
    advertisers. These parties have their own privacy policies addressing how they handle
    user information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Cookie Usage and Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    Aside from the cookies used by third-party ads (described above), our site itself does
    not use tracking cookies. If you prefer to limit or disable cookies, you can do so
    through your web browser settings. You can also opt out of personalized advertising by
    using industry opt-out pages like the Digital Advertising Alliance. Please note that
    opting out of ad cookies does not mean you will see no ads, only that they will not be
    personalized to your interests.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
  <p>
    Our website may contain links to external sites or use third-party services (such as
    the advertising and analytics tools mentioned). If you click on a third-party link,
    you will be directed to that third party’s site. We have no control over and assume no
    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party
    websites or services.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    CalcSimpler.com is not directed to children. If you are a parent or guardian and
    believe your child has provided personal data on our site, please contact us so we can
    remove that information.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take security seriously. Because we do not collect personal data through our
    calculators, there is no sensitive calculator input data stored on our servers. For
    the limited data we do handle (for example, anonymized analytics or server logs), we
    implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
    practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post any
    changes on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay
    informed about how we are protecting your information.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us. We
    will be happy to address your inquiries.
