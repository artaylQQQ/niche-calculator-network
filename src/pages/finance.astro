/**
 * This page existed in earlier versions of CalcSimpler as a bespoke
 * category listing for Finance.  To unify the design and avoid
 * duplicating logic, we now serve all category pages under
 * `/categories/<slug>/`.  When a visitor or search engine requests
 * `/finance`, we immediately redirect to the new Finance category
 * location at `/categories/finance/`.  A short paragraph is included
 * for browsers that ignore the meta refresh.
