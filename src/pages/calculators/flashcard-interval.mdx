  intro: "Use this calculator to estimate the next review interval in a spaced repetition system. Multiply the previous interval by an ease factor to plan your study schedule.",
  examples: [
    { description: "4-day interval with 2.5 ease \u21d2 10 days" },
    { description: "10-day interval with 1.5 ease \u21d2 15 days" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "What is the ease factor?", answer: "A multiplier reflecting how well you remembered the material." },
    { question: "Can the ease factor be less than 1?", answer: "Yes, values below 1 shorten the next interval." },
    { question: "Should intervals be whole numbers?", answer: "They can include decimals; round as needed for your schedule." },
    { question: "Does this replace SRS software?", answer: "No, it's a simple aid for manual planning." }
