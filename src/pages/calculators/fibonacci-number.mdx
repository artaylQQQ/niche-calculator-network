    { question: "Can I use negative numbers?", answer: "This calculator works for non-negative integers only." },
    { question: "Why is the result rounded?", answer: "Binet's formula uses decimals, so rounding gives the exact integer." },

    { question: "Is there a faster way to compute?", answer: "This closed-form expression avoids iterative calculation." }
