  "intro": "This converter changes water hardness from parts per million (ppm) to grains per gallon (gpg). Enter hardness in ppm to see the equivalent gpg.",

    {"description": "180 ppm ⇒ 10.52 gpg"},
    {"description": "60 ppm ⇒ 3.51 gpg"}
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {"question": "What is water hardness?", "answer": "It measures dissolved minerals, mainly calcium and magnesium, expressed as calcium carbonate."},
    {"question": "How do I convert ppm to gpg?", "answer": "Divide the ppm value by 17.118 to obtain grains per gallon."},
    {"question": "Does a higher gpg mean harder water?", "answer": "Yes, larger gpg values indicate harder water."},
    {"question": "Can this calculator handle very high values?", "answer": "Yes, but residential water usually stays below 30 gpg."}
