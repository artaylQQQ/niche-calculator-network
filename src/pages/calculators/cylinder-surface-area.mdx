    { description: "r=3, h=5 ⇒ 150.80 sq units" },

  faqs: [
    { question: "What if I know diameter?", answer: "Divide diameter by 2 to get radius." },
    { question: "Are units required?", answer: "Use any consistent unit; result is in squared form." },
    { question: "Does it include top and bottom?", answer: "Yes, total surface area covers both bases and the side." },
    { question: "Can height be zero?", answer: "Yes, then the result is the area of two circles." }
