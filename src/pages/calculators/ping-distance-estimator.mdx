  intro: "Estimate the one-way distance a signal travels based on round-trip ping time. Enter the ping in milliseconds to approximate how far away the server might be.",
  examples: [
    { description: "50 ms ⇒ ~7,494 km" },
    { description: "20 ms ⇒ ~2,998 km" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "Why divide by two?", answer: "Ping measures round-trip time, so distance is half." },
    { question: "Is this the actual path length?", answer: "No, it assumes a straight line and doesn't account for network routing." },
    { question: "Does the medium affect speed?", answer: "Yes, fiber and copper transmit slightly slower than the speed of light in vacuum." },
    { question: "Why are results approximate?", answer: "Network delays, hardware, and routing can affect ping times." }
