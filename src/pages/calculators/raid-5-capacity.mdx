  intro: "Compute usable capacity of a RAID 5 array based on drive count and individual drive size.",
  inputs: [
    { name: "drives", label: "Number of Drives", type: "number", step: "1", placeholder: "4" },
    { name: "size", label: "Drive Size (TB)", type: "number", step: "any", placeholder: "2" }

  examples: [
    { description: "4 drives at 2 TB ⇒ 6 TB" },
    { description: "6 drives at 4 TB ⇒ 20 TB" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "Why subtract one drive?", answer: "RAID 5 uses the capacity of one drive for parity." },
    { question: "What is the minimum number of drives?", answer: "RAID 5 requires at least three drives." },
    { question: "Do drives need to be the same size?", answer: "Yes, capacity is limited by the smallest drive." },
    { question: "Does this include filesystem overhead?", answer: "No, actual usable space may be slightly less." }
