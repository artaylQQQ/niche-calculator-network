    {
      question: "What is the minimum number of sides?",
      answer: "At least 3 sides are required for a polygon.",

      question: "Does it work for concave polygons?",
      answer: "Yes, the formula applies to any simple polygon.",

      question: "Is this for regular polygons only?",
      answer: "No, regular and irregular polygons share the same angle sum.",

      question: "Why multiply by 180?",
      answer: "Each triangle has 180°, and a polygon can be divided into (n−2) triangles.",
