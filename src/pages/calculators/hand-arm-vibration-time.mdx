    { description: "10 m/s² with 5 m/s² limit ⇒ 2 h" },

  faqs: [
    { question: "What is the default limit?", answer: "5 m/s² is a common regulatory action limit." },
    { question: "Does it account for multiple tools?", answer: "No, it assumes a single constant vibration level." },
    { question: "Can exposure exceed 8 hours?", answer: "The formula may yield more than 8 h, but regulations typically cap at 8 h." },
    { question: "Why square the ratio?", answer: "Exposure time is inversely proportional to the square of the vibration magnitude." }
