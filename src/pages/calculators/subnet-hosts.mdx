    { question: "What is a CIDR prefix?", answer: "It's the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask." },
    { question: "Why subtract 2 hosts?", answer: "Network and broadcast addresses are not usable." },
    { question: "Can prefixes be 31 or 32?", answer: "Yes, but they allow at most 0 or 1 usable host." },
