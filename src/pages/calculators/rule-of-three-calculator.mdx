    {"question": "What is the rule of three?","answer": "It finds a fourth proportional value: if A is to B as C is to X, then X = B × C / A."},
    {"question": "Can the inputs be decimals?","answer": "Yes, the calculator accepts both whole numbers and decimals."},
    {"question": "What if A is zero?","answer": "The calculation is undefined when A is 0 because division by zero is not possible."},
    {"question": "Do the units need to match?","answer": "Yes. A and C share the same units, while B and the result share another."}
