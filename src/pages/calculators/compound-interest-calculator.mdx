      {"question": "What is compound interest?", "answer": "Interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of prior periods."},
      {"question": "How do I choose the compounding frequency?", "answer": "Use the number of times interest is added per year, such as 12 for monthly or 4 for quarterly."},
      {"question": "What if the rate or years is zero?", "answer": "If the rate or time is zero, the future value equals the principal since no growth occurs."},
      {"question": "Does this assume reinvestment of interest?", "answer": "Yes, all earned interest is reinvested each period according to the compounding frequency."}
