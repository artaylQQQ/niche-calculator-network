  intro: "Approximate how far lightning struck by multiplying the seconds until thunder by the speed of sound in air (0.343 km/s).",
  inputs: [
    { name: "seconds", label: "Seconds After Flash", type: "number", step: "any", placeholder: "3" }
  ],
  expression: "seconds * 0.343",
  unit: "km",
  examples: [
    { description: "3 s ⇒ 1.03 km" },
    { description: "5 s ⇒ 1.72 km" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "Why use 0.343 km/s?", answer: "It's the approximate speed of sound in air at sea level." },
    { question: "Does wind affect the result?", answer: "Wind and temperature can slightly change sound speed." },
    { question: "Can I get distance in miles?", answer: "Multiply seconds by 0.213 to convert to miles." },
    { question: "Is this exact?", answer: "It's an estimate; terrain and atmospheric conditions may alter sound travel." }
