  intro: "Calculate the approximate uncompressed bitmap file size using image dimensions and bit depth. Enter width, height, and bits per pixel to estimate size in megabytes.",
  examples: [
    { description: "1920\u00d71080 at 24-bit \u21d2 5.93 MB" },
    { description: "800\u00d7600 at 8-bit \u21d2 0.46 MB" }

  faqs: [
    { question: "Does this include compression?", answer: "No, it assumes uncompressed bitmap data." },
    { question: "What about alpha channels?", answer: "Include them in the bit depth if present." },
    { question: "Can I use it for JPEGs?", answer: "JPEG uses compression, so actual file size will be smaller." },
    { question: "Why divide by 8388608?", answer: "It's the number of bits in a megabyte (1024\u00b2 bytes)." }
