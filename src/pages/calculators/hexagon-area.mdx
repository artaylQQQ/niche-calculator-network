  intro: "Find the area of a regular hexagon using the standard formula based on side length. Enter the side length and press Calculate.",
  inputs: [
    { name: "side", label: "Side Length", type: "number", step: "any", placeholder: "2" }
  ],
  expression: "(3 * Math.sqrt(3) / 2) * side * side",
  unit: "unit²",
  examples: [
    { description: "Side 2 ⇒ 10.39 unit²" },
    { description: "Side 5 ⇒ 64.95 unit²" },
    { description: "Side 10 ⇒ 259.81 unit²" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "Where does the formula come from?", answer: "It derives from dividing the hexagon into equilateral triangles." },
    { question: "What units are used?", answer: "Any consistent length unit; output is squared." },
    { question: "Does this work for irregular hexagons?", answer: "No, it assumes all sides and angles are equal." }
