    { question: "Is this conversion exact?", answer: "It uses the standard conversion factor and is precise for most purposes." },
    { question: "Can I convert negative pressures?", answer: "Negative values represent vacuum relative to atmospheric pressure and are allowed." },
    { question: "What is mmHg?", answer: "Millimeters of mercury, a unit commonly used for blood pressure and barometric pressure." },
