  inputs: [
    { name: "length", label: "Password length", type: "number", step: "1", placeholder: "12" },

    { description: "Length 8 with 62 chars ⇒ 47.6 bits" },

  faqs: [
    { question: "What is entropy?", answer: "A measure of unpredictability in bits." },
    { question: "How do I know charset size?", answer: "Count unique symbols used, e.g., 26 letters + 10 digits." },
    { question: "Does this account for dictionary words?", answer: "No, it assumes random selection of characters." },
    { question: "Is higher entropy always better?", answer: "Generally yes, higher entropy means stronger passwords." }
