  intro: "Convert electronvolt energy to joules using the factor 1 eV = 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ J. Enter eV and press Calculate.",
  inputs: [
    { name: "ev", label: "Energy (eV)", type: "number", step: "any", placeholder: "1" }
  ],
  expression: "ev * 1.602176634e-19",
  unit: "J",
  examples: [
    { description: "1 eV ⇒ 1.60e-19 J" },
    { description: "5 eV ⇒ 8.01e-19 J" }
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "What is an electronvolt?", answer: "The energy gained by an electron moving through a potential difference of one volt." },
    { question: "Is the conversion factor exact?", answer: "Yes, it's defined by fundamental physical constants." },
    { question: "Can I convert large energies?", answer: "Yes, just enter the value in electronvolts." },
    { question: "Does temperature affect the conversion?", answer: "No, it's purely a unit conversion." }
