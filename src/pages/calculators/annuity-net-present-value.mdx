    "A positive NPV means the annuity's returns exceed the chosen discount rate.",
    "Selecting an appropriate discount rate is crucial, as it represents the required rate of return.",

    { "question": "What is NPV?", "answer": "Net present value measures today's value of future cash flows minus the initial cost." },
