  faqs: [
    { question: "Why adjust for extensions?", answer: "Extensions alter the lever arm, affecting applied torque." },
    { question: "Does this work for 90° extensions?", answer: "Yes, when the extension is inline with the wrench." },
    { question: "Can I use inches?", answer: "Yes, use consistent units for wrench and extension lengths." },
    { question: "What if extension length is zero?", answer: "The formula returns the desired torque unchanged." }
