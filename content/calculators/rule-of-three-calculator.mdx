description: Solve proportions using the rule of three (If a is to b as c is to xâ€¦).
schema: {"title": "Rule of Three Calculator", "slug": "rule-of-three-calculator", "intro": "Solve proportions of the form a:b = c:x.", "inputs": [{"name": "a", "label": "A", "step": "any"}, {"name": "b", "label": "B", "step": "any"}, {"name": "c", "label": "C", "step": "any"}], "expression": "(b * c) / a"}
faqs: [["How does it work?", "We compute x so that a/b = c/x, hence x = (b \u00d7 c) / a."]]
